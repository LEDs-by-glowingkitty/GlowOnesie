## Washing & ironing instructions
- wash silk and shiny polyester before sewing
- wash onesie/silk ideally by hand, or else in the washing machine with a laundry bag. Use silk detergent.
- when ironing the silk, make sure to place another fabric between the silk and the iron, while ironing the back side of the silk on low heat setting. Do no iron the front of the silk directly, when possible.

## Sewing instructions

1. Sewing patterns (~ 60 min)

    Print & cut the sewing patterns, ideally with a plotter as single pieces in full size or else on A4 paper and tape the parts together

2. Cut fabric (~ 60 min)

    Place the sewing patterns on the fabric and cut them. Make sure the fabric is properly alligned. The most flexible direction of the fabrics should go from left to right, not top to bottom. Safe yourself time by placing multiple layers of the same fabric above each other for cutting mirrored patterns.

3. Prepare zippers (~ 40 min)

    Prepare the middle zipper first.
